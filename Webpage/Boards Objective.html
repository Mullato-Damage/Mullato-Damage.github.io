    <h2> This is the description of my Robotics degree and the objectives that I will work to achieve while I'm in school and even in the workforce.<br> <br>
        ROBOTICS AND EMBEDDED SYSTEMS<br>
        The world we interact in everyday and the technology we utilize are built upon the foundation of embedded systems. The
        Robotics and Embedded Systems degree provides students the engineering foundation for the design, implementation and
        analysis of embedded systems, with an emphasis in autonomous robotic systems. Building upon the foundation of software
        engineering, a degree in Robotics and Embedded Systems can span mechanical design, digital logic design, embedded
        programming, machine vision, and adaptive algorithm development and design of autonomous robotic systems.<br>

    <h3> ROBOTICS AND EMBEDDED SYSTEMS DEGREE OBJECTIVES<br>
        1. Design and complete robotic and embedded systems solutions that apply to real-world situations and challenges.<br>
        2. Implement a simple microprocessor using digital logic design.<br>
        3. Demonstrate embedded system design skills, including, but not limited to, microcontroller selection, schematic design,
        printed circuit board layout, design for electromagnetic compatibility and design for manufacturing.<br>
        4. Apply knowledge of transducers, actuators and simultaneous hardware and software development in the design of an
        embedded system.<br>
        5. Design and analyze real-time embedded systems, including advanced digital logic design, signal processing and highspeed digital systems.<br>
        6. Implement and evaluate algorithms and methods enabling autonomy in a mobile robot.<br></h3>
