    CAN YOU CLEAR THE DUNGEON?</H1>
<!--The second header, to give a piece of the games plot. My hook!-->
<h2>Be careful of Thormir the Dragon!</h2>
<!--The basis to the plot-->
<h3>Game Rules: 2+ Players have to rely on 2d6 dice after Thormir stole the rest of your dice and retreated into his Dungeon.</h3>
<h4>
<!--The glorious rules of the game and the fate of each outcome-->
Take turns rolling your dice and see if you have the might to clear Thormir's Dungeon!
<br>
<br>
1. Role 2 or 4; you find a Mimic acting as die, skip your turn!
<br>
2. Role 3 or 5; you find your die, extra turn!
<br>
3. Role a double 5; you'll blow a hole through the dungeon, you crazy beast!
<br>
4. Role 7 or 11; YOU CLEAR THE DUNGEON! CONGRATS EXPLORER!
<br>
5. Role a 12; YOU SLAY THORMIR AND GATHER HIS RICHES! ENJOY YOUR FORTUNE!
<br>
6. Role a 0; you'll be seen as the unluckiest person alive- or should I say dead, since Thormir will swoop in and eat you!
<br>
7. Role any other number; you continue to the next part of the dungeon.
